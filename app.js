//The homepage of your microblog app should be a list of these micro-posts with a form to add a new one. 

// Your HTML page should have a list in it that will display the posts. It can be empty, with JS adding posts, or have some dummy posts in it to start.
// Your JS will hold an array of posts that it appends to the HTML list.
// When your user clicks submit, your JS should handle taking the content of the form and putting it in that array, and updating the DOM.
// Make frequent commits and pushes. You should commit every time you add a new feature, and it is working! A feature can be something as small as adding a little style.
